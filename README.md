DMARKY IS NOT THE BIGGEST BIRD!!!
 Don't know what you've heard (Don't know what you've heard)
Don't know what you've heard (I don't know what you heard)
I don't know what you heard
Don't know what you heard (I don't know, I don't know)
… But I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird (Bird)
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird (Bird)
… Bigger than a cassowary, or you're an ostrich (Me)
They wanna be like me, but they can't be like this
(You can't compare, )
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird (I'm the biggest bird)
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird (I'm the biggest bird)
Walked in, they scared of me (I got 'em scared)
They wanna be like Mer', it's no comparison (Can't compare)
They wanna be like Chickadee singin' in the wind
(Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet)
Pulled up with an AK, yeah, I'm not him (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bigger than a Moa
(Bigger than 'em, bigger than 'em)
They scared when I show up (Bigger than 'em, bigger than 'em)
They scared of the claws that took my legs (Oh my gosh, oh my gosh)
They scared of my gun the side of this egg (Oh my gosh, oh my gosh)
I'm the biggest bird, it's so absurd (It's crazy, )
I'm the biggest bird, how have you not heard
(How ain't you heard? How ain't you heard?)
Don't know what you heard
Don't know what you heard, don't know what you heard
But, I'm the biggest bird (I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird)
I'm the biggest bird
… I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird (Purchase this beat)
I'm the biggest bird, I'm the biggest bird
… When I walk in (Who I is? Who I is?)
They always flying above me, don't wanna give me no company,
It's okay with me (Bird)
You can't be on my perch (You cannot, you cannot)
You can't rest in my roost (No you can't, no you can't)
I already know how you do (Already know, already know)
Biggest bird that's me
